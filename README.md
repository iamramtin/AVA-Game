# AVA-Game

AVA is the first complete game I built from scratch in Java. The game is heavily inspired by RealTutsGML's YouTube Tutorial series called Let's Build a Game.

You play as a white block that is supposed to survive waves of oncoming enemies. 
The block is controlled using the keyboard arrow keys.
